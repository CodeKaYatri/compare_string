### String Comparison in C (Turbo C3)

This is a simple C program written and compiled using Turbo C3. It compares two strings entered by the user and displays whether they are **equal** or **not equal**.

 **Key Features**:
- Takes input for two strings from the user
- Uses manual character-by-character comparison (not `strcmp`)
- Displays a clear result: `Strings are equal` or `Strings are not equal`
- Fully compatible with Turbo C3 (16-bit compiler)

**Why Turbo C3?**
This code is tailored for students and beginners practicing on **Turbo C3**, which is still used in many Indian colleges for learning C basics.

 **Usage**:
- Open Turbo C3
- Paste the code
- Compile and run the program
- Input two strings when prompted

 **Educational Value**:
This project helps beginners understand how string comparison works without using built-in functions like `strcmp`. Great for learning loops, arrays, and conditionals in C.
